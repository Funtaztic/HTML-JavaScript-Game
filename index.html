<h4>I have one user who is having issue with opening his Outlook 2013.   He started having this issue staring Monday.  He is remote and it has been difficult to troubleshoot.  When he attempts to have open he gets a message which I have attached a pic of. This will work until the next time he restarts his system and then it comes back again.  I don't see where he installed anything this past week that would interfere with his Outlook system.  Googling has led me to the above.  Trying to find my happy place.</h4>
