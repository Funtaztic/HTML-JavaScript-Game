Make lists for collectibles.

Collectibles: which approach would be better?
  1. Variables: (probably better, as they have power and/or durability)
    sword = 0 (where 0 means "you don't have it", and 1 means "yes, you have it") 
    shield = 0 (maybe the number should represent the strength of the item. 0 is no item, 10 is weak shield, 200 is powerful)
    helmet = 0

  2. List:
    ['sword', 'shield', 'helmet']
